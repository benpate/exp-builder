## Safe queries from URL query strings

Expression Builder works with the [exp expression library](https://github.com/benpate/exp) to define templates that are safely populated with data from a URL query string.  More documentation to come.

```go

func Handler(r *http.Request, w http.ResponseWriter) {

	// Define the URL arguments you want to allow and their types
	b := NewBuilder().
		String("firstName").
		String("lastName").
		Int("publishDate").
		Bool("isPublished")

	// Create a usable expression from the URL query string
	expression := b.Evaluate(r.URL.Query())

	// Next, safely pass it into the database, or something...
}
```
